## About this project

This project demonstrates data modeling, engineering and analysis skills utilizing ERD design tools and PostgreSQL. 

The project contains multiple CSV files with employee, department and salary data from a fictional company. Using QuickDBD, I've designed an ERD and built a database schema that best fits the data. After that, I used the generated schema to build the database using PostgreSQL, and imported the data from the CSV files. Finally, I completed a brief analysis of the data, demonstrating the use of table joins as well as 'where', 'group by', and 'order by' clauses.
